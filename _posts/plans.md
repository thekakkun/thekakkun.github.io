## Objectives

### Site functionality

- The content and coding of my site should act as a showcase for my skillset.
- Let people know who I am.
- Act as a repository for my personal projects/writing.
- Provide a way for people to connect with me.

### Personal

Learn more about:

- Modern front-end development
  - Static site generation using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- Automated testing
  - [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) seems popular?
- Creating a markdown based blog
  - How can I convert markdown files into blog posts?
  - Can I use commit logs to automatically show post/update dates on the post? Is that a good idea?
  - Provide tags so that posts can be easily filtered
