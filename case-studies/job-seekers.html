    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>Outline</h3>
    <p>
      An American tech company tasked us with running the Japanese phase of a
      global study they were conducting to understand local job seekers and
      get feedback on their newly-released job aggregator.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Phases & Goals</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Desk Research</h4>
        <p>2 weeks</p>
        <p>
          Create a common baseline with our clients regarding job searching
          norms for Japanese people.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>User Interviews</h4>
        <p>6 weeks</p>
        <p>
          Find out how Japanese job seekers were looking for job postings and
          what their current pain points were.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Survey</h4>
        <p>5 weeks</p>
        <p>
          Gather data on websites and search methods used by users as well as
          their satisfaction.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>My Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Project manager</li>
      <li>Main point of contact for client and outsourcing partners</li>
      <li>
        Researcher for user interview phase, lead researcher for survey phase
      </li>
      <li>Presentation of findings to client for all phases</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase 1 – Desk Research</h2>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gather information on the types of employment available in Japan as
        well as past and current trends.
      </li>
      <li>Create a report and present to the client.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      It was important that our clients understood the idiosyncrasies
      surrounding Japanese job culture.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        While attitudes are changing, many Japanese employers expect workers
        to stay at the company until retirement. Progression within the
        company is dependent not only on job performance, but loyalty to the
        company as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to stop companies from recruiting the top students early, and
        in order to allow students to focus on school work, job openings for
        new graduates are posted on the same date by all major companies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <p>
      The contents of the presentation were used by the clients to inform what
      they wanted to pursue for the following phases of the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      After discussion, we defined the following user segments for the user
      interview and survey: (a) new graduates, (b) general job seekers, and
      (c) recent retirees.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 2 – User Interviews</h2>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        90-minute one-on-one interviews with 12 participants (New graduates,
        general job seekers, recent retirees)
      </li>
      <li>
        Note-taking in observation room as well as providing context and
        analysis for clients.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><em></em>New graduates only use 2 select job search sites</p>
        <p>
          They were satisfied with just using the sites which were endorsed by
          their colleges. They felt that they would become overwhelmed if they
          added any other job sites into their routine.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Recent retirees were frustrated at the jobs available to them</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Many recent retirees were still looking to work as they wanted to
          make use of their time and contribute to society. However, they
          found that the jobs hiring seniors involved menial tasks, and the
          jobs they felt were more worthwhile went to younger applicants.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Participants found it difficult to use the client’s job search
            tool</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          While Japanese participants were used to initiating their search
          through filters, they client’s tool required participants to enter a
          keyword before getting results. In addition, many of the provided
          filters were not well localized for Japanese users.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase 3 – Survey</h2>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>Online survey with 300 samples</p>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      The screening criteria and questions provided by the client were not
      well defined enough for me to create a translated Japanese survey that
      would be easy for respondents to complete.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I worked with clients to understand the data they wanted to gather
        from the survey, and localized the Japanese version so that the
        terminology used within the survey was in-line with the respondent’s
        mental models.
      </li>
      <li>
        The screener and survey structure was overhauled in order to ensure
        that respondents did not need to answer unnecessary questions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>The majority of respondents mentioned that they still used
            offline resources</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people still used offline resources as part of their current
          job search. Some frequently used resources included: free job
          advertisement magazines and the employment service centre run by the
          Japanese government.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>About half of the respondents had never seen or used the client’s
            job search tool</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the participants that had experience with it, a majority were
          satisfied with it.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      After all research phases were completed, the clients held a workshop to
      summarize the findings from the study. I was invited to the workshop in
      order to provide additional context into the Japanese employment and job
      seeking experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The workshop concluded with us coming up with some “how might we?”
        questions that demanded further consideration.</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>As a job aggregator, how might we provide useful job filters
            dynamically?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Japanese users expected very detailed job filters that include job
          fields and sub-fields, distance from train stations, etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>How might we signal to users which jobs are willing to hire older
            workers while also considering age discrimination?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent retirees were finding it difficult to find and get selected
          for meaningful roles post-retirement.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>How might we provide value to students without further
            overwhelming them?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most new graduates only use two select job search sites and find
          information provided by them to be overwhelming.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
